# (Sta)ndard Pollen Typographic Library, a(men)

This is a utility library of standard typographic features for pollen.
This is mostly for my own use, but anybody who wants to use it is of course free to.

Currently in version alpha-1.0. It will be in 1.0 when I have the current set of typographic features fully defined:
- p (paragraph)
- tlist (typographic list)
- litem (list item)
- hrule (horizontal rule)
- figure
- tbox
- heading

for each of these targets:
- md (markdown)
- txt (text)
- html (hypertext markup language)
- ltx (latex)
- pdf (pdf)
